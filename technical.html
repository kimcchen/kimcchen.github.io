            <p> The Tiny Distributed Social Network was a project that aimed to imitiate how a real, distributed social network functioned in order to gained
                a better understanding of distributed systems as a whole. Initially, this social network existed on only one system, but as the project
                gradually expanded, I had to implement aspects of distributed synchronization, locking, and load balancing concepts to effectively manage the 
                system. I used gRPC and Protobufs to provide that efficient server-client communication, and integrated Apache Zookeeper for configuration 
                management of large clusters over a distributed system. Overall, this project was a great way for me to really see the effects and challenges
                that occur when going from a single system to a distributed one.

            Users can open shared capsules by arriving in the vicinity (~50 meters) of the location where the capsule was created. 
            When nearby, a green location marker will pop up, indicating the ready-to-open capsule. When opened, users are able to see all 
            the attached notes, images, and videos inside the capsule. These opened capsules are then placed in the 'opened' tab in the capsules page.

            <p>CapsuleMap is a lifestyle app aimed at keeping users mentally and physically healthy. At a desired place, users may choose to create a capsule, 
            adding a title, memo, photos, and/or videos that reflect their sentiment towards the current location. After creating it, users can choose to share 
            the capsule with friends. After the capsule has been sent, it will appear in the "sent" tab in the user's capsules page, making it easy to keep 
            track of personal capsules.

                HealthID aims to streamline personal health tracking through a comprehensive health logging system. 
                Users may fill out a short daily form to record various activities such as exercise or sleep as well as any physical ailments 
                such as a fever or cough. They may also choose to record any updates in their height or weight. These entries are saved to the 
                user's account, making it easy to track health-related changes.

                Users can share this information with others through a custom generated QR code and link, which brings up a 
                website displaying all the user's logs that anyone can access. Through a quick scan, all this medical information is 
                easily accessible. While seeing doctors remotely, doctors may check a patient's log to view any possible lifestyle issues 
                that could cause disease.
