    <h2>
        What is TypeScript?
    </h2>
    <p>
        TypeScript is an open-source programming language that builds upon JavaScript by adding static typing to the language. What static typing means,
        as opposed to dynamic typing, is that developers are now able to define data types for their variables, function parameters, and return values. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why TypeScript?
    </h2>
    <p>
        TypeScript has many advantages when it comes to Web Development. With the addition of static typing, TypeScript can make code more robust
        and maintainable because type-related errors are caught earlier on in the development process. In addition, since TypeScript is a superset of 
        JavaScript, any code that is written in JavaScript is valid TypeScript code too, so developers can gradually adpot TypeScript without
        rewriting everything.
