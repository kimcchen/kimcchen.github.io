            <h5>Technical Skills</h5>
            <p>
                I have experience in multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, and Dart. I have the most experience in C++, but I've worked
                extensively with Java in my previous internship and current position as a part-time software developer. I work with Python most in my
                Machine Learning course and have worked with Dart during hackathons in the past. In addition to programming languages, I have experience in 
                Application Development as well as Web Development. I've dabbled in App development because I believe they are the most fun to build
                during hackathons. Along the way, I've picked up Google Cloud Platform Firebase and Authentication, as well as a bit of AWS for the app's 
                database. I also worked with Google's Flutter software for the app's frontend. During my previous internship I utilized with Google Web Toolkit 
                to create some styling changes and bug fixes for their investigative software's web platform. I've also created a Cinco Ranch High School 
                Orchestra webpage which allowed me to practice using PHP, HTML, and some CSS. Lastly, I'm familiar with Agile Methodologies and how software
                development cycles operate within those methods.

            <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                While I am still figuring out exactly what I want to do in the vast field of Computer Science, I find that I do have some interest in Mobile
                App Development and general software engineering. My favorite part of App development is taking an idea from concept to creation. I enjoy
                taking the time to think of possible ideas and bouncing them off of other people, and then going to Figma to prototype. Then, taking that prototype
                and making something tangible out of it is also a really exciting part of App Development. I feel as though I'm inclined towards Software 
                Engineering because I like solving problems and making things work. Over the summer, I was responsible for many tasks, from implementing new software
                features, to working on their backlog of bugs. I really got to exercise my creativity when it came to implementing new software features, and I also 
                got to feed my appetite for problem-solving with the many bugs that I was assigned.
