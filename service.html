                I believe that service is important and allows me to give back to my community. One way in which I have participated in service was 
                through my FLO, or freshman leadership organization MSC Fish. As a service based organization, I was introduced to a lot of cool
                service opportunities in the Bryan - College Station area, such as volunteering at a 2nd chance resale store or eating lunch with a kindergartener
                at Jones Elementary every other Friday. Looking back, I'm very glad to have been able to help those people, and in turn the community, in those
                ways, and I want to continue looking for opprotunities like those while I'm still here in college. Over the summer during my internship, I was 
                able to pack food for Feed my Starving Children. Not only was a a great bonding experience for the interns in the company and those in Eagan, MN
                community, but it was also fulfilling packing food less fortunate children who needed it. In the future, I hope to be able to use my 
                Computer Science skills to contribute to a non-profit organization.
